# Single Scan

{% hint style="success" %}
A tutorial video is available at the bottom of the page.
{% endhint %}

Contrary to the Batch Extraction implementation, the single-scan feature extraction provides great flexibility through a drag-and-drop design. This enables users to customize their Radiomics analysis for a specific image. In this mode, users have control over the processing steps and the features to be extracted. Moreover, additional features such as 3D image visualization are available.

The following image summarizes the available resources in the single scan interface:

Having gained an understanding of the various components of the extraction interface, the following section illustrates the available nodes, highlighting their individual functionalities, inputs, and outputs.

To select the features to extract, click on the extraction node, a page will appear (see figure below) and you will be able to select feature families and features to extract for your analysis.
